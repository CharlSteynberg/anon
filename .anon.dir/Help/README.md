### Introduction
Anon aims to be useful for any kind of project, so wether your business is about web-design -or not, Anon can help; it has built-in task management, time keeping and billing support to help you manage your daily routine. Best of all, it's free.

**Anon for humans**
If you are NOT into web-design, then skip the rest of this intro (it will confuse us both) and instead have a look at:
[Using Anon only for task management](#using-anon-only-for-task-management).
..

**Anon for the rest of us**
If you are into web-application -or web-site development, you'd be delighted to know that Anon has:
- a simple graphics editor to use for quick image editing such as cropping, rotation, clipping, brightness, etc.
- a simple code editor that supports syntax highlighting, find & replace, project-wide-search, auto-indentation and db-sproc editing
- an application layout designer that supports templates, mock-ups, mind-maps, codeless-programming
- automated version control via sub-repositories using Git for multi-user collaboration
- built-in remote file & database support for editing external code or graphics via FTP or MySql, etc.
- automated task progress tracking in terms of flow (pipeline) and customer feedback (via email) on task events

There are tutorials available for any role(s) you assume as a logged in user. If you need help, have a look in the main `HELP` menu under `User/manual`.
