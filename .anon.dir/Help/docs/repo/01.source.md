# Git repository source
The `remote origin` of a repository is used by **Git** when *pulling* or *pushing* commits (changes).
> By default **Anon** uses Git via `https`, so if you want to use Git via another protocol, consult the [official Git docs](https://git-scm.com/doc)


## Troubleshooting
When you run into issues like ***not found*** or ***forbidden***, you need to change your `remote origin` URL.
- If this repo is in a sub-folder of *root*, then you can simply right-click the container in any ***tree-menu*** and modify it.
- If this repo ***IS*** your *root* then you'll need to run a special command in the *terminal* as a ***sudo*** user.

### forbidden
If you ran into the "forbidden" error, it means the `remote origin` is "private" and you'll need to provide credentials.
> The following commands need ***sudo*** priviledges

Use the terminal to navigate to the root of the repository:
```bash
cd /
```

To reveal this repo's `remote origin` URL:
```bash
sudo sh `git remote get-url origin`
```

You can use the URL you got from the previous command, then change (or insert) the `user` and `pass` (credentials):
```bash
sudo sh `git remote set-url origin https://USER:PASS@www.example.com/repoName.git`
```

> you'll need to change **USER** and **PASS** (and all the other stuff) to the actual details


## Push to multiple repositories
If you want to ***push*** your repository to multiple ***mirror*** repositories, you can use the ollowing command to ***add*** extra repositories:
```bash
sudo sh `git remote set-url origin --push --add 'https://USER:PASS@www.other.dom/repoName.git'`
```

If you encounter the `[rejected] .. fetch first` error upon push -and you know all should be fine, then you may need to run something like the command directly below; however,
this should only be necessary to run once; i you enounter it more than once then something is wrong with your pull/push pipe-line elsewhere.
```bash
sudo sh `git push origin master --force`
```
