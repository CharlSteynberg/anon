# PHP Zip Class
A better PHP zipping/unzipping class.

## The problem
When building a CMS that is supposed to be redistributable and functioning on a range of hosting solutions (shared, VPS, dedicated) a problem often occurs in zipping and unzipping files. since not all PHP installation have the `zipArchive` class exists.

##### Case: Duplicator plugin for WordPress
For a number of clients, a problem seemed often occurring due to missing `zipArchive` class:

- [VPS](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-duplicator-no-zip-archive-enabled-on-vps-what-next)
- [VPS again](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-duplicator-ziparchive-extension-required-for-compression)
- [Shared dreamhost](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dreamhost-duplicator-and-ziparchive)
- [Shared X10 Hosting](https://x10hosting.com/community/threads/zip-extension-how-to-turn-on-please-help.193531/)
- [Shared dreamhost](https://discussion.dreamhost.com/thread-136038.html)
- [cPanel](https://forums.cpanel.net/threads/installing-activating-php-ziparchive-module.470511/)
- [Yet another case](http://codecharismatic.com/the-stupid-zip-archive-and-wordpress-duplicator-issue/)

However, although the plugin itself is was distributed as a zip file, the WordPress code was **able** to unzip and install it. This is because the WordPress core code will check if the `zipArchive` class exists, and if it does not, it will use the `PclZip` class which can be included as a PHP file and considered as an alternative for `zipArchive`.

## The solution

In this class, I tried to solve this problem in the same approach that the WordPress core team did; by checking if the class `zipArchive` exists or not, and using `PclZip` if it does not.

This does **NOT** solve missing the `zlib` extension which  is a requirement even for the `PclZip` class. However, missing the `zlib` extension is less common than just missing the `zipArchive` class.

This class also provides a very simple and intuitive way of dealing with zip files.

## Installation

To install this class, simply upload the `src` folder contents to your server and include the `Zip.php` file.

Note: To install in CodeIgniter create a folder called `zip` in your in `application/libraries/` and put the `src` folder contents inside of it, then load it using the library loader `$this->load->library("zip/zip");`.

## Usage Examples:

Note: When I wrote this class, I intended to use it in a multi-line fashion (You'll see what I mean). However, I decided later that I should make a shorthand for this, so it would be usable in a one-line style.

### Adding new files to the zip / Creating new zip file:
#### Multi-line style
- **PHP**:
```php
    require_once "path/to/src/zip.php";
    $zip = new Zip();
    $zip->zip_start("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip");
    $zip->zip_add("path/to/example.png"); // adding a file
    $zip->zip_add(array("path/to/example1.png","path/to/example2.png")); // adding two files as an array
    $zip->zip_add(array("path/to/example1.png","path/to/directory/")); // adding one file and one directory
    $zip->zip_end();
```
- **CodeIgniter**:
```php
	$this->load->library("zip/zip");
    $this->zip->zip_start("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip");
    $this->zip->zip_add("path/to/example.png"); // adding a file
    $this->zip->zip_add(array("path/to/example1.png","path/to/example2.png")); // adding two files as an array
    $this->zip->zip_add(array("path/to/example1.png","path/to/directory/")); // adding one file and one directory
    $this->zip->zip_end();
```

#### one-line style
- **PHP**:
```php
    require_once "path/to/src/zip.php";
    $zip = new Zip();
    $zip->zip_files(array("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip","path/to/directory/"),"path/to/zip/file.zip");
```
- **CodeIgniter**:
```php
	$this->load->library("zip/zip");
    $this->zip->zip_files(array("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip","path/to/directory/"),"path/to/zip/file.zip");
```

### Extracting (unzipping) files:
#### Multi-line style
- **PHP**:
```php
    require_once "path/to/src/zip.php";
    $zip = new Zip();
    $zip->unzip_file("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip");
    $zip->unzip_to("path/to/containing/directory/");
```
- **CodeIgniter**:
```php
	 $this->load->library("zip/zip");
    $this->zip->unzip_file("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip");
    $this->zip->unzip_to("path/to/containing/directory/");
```

#### one-line style
- **PHP**:
```php
    require_once "path/to/src/zip.php";
    $zip = new Zip();
    $zip->unzip_file("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip","path/to/containing/directory/");
```
- **CodeIgniter**:
```php
	 $this->load->library("zip/zip");
    $this->zip->unzip_file("path/to/new/or/old/zip_file.zip","path/to/containing/directory/");
```

> Note: The library will throw a new exception in case of error and will return true in case of success.

## Testing
```
    cd test && php test.php
```
