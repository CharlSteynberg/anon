You can change your password to something easy to remember, like: `R00k13!`

It dawned upon the powers that be that you may need to know ***how to login***
- use your favorite web browser and go here: https://(~HOSTNAME~)
- position your pointer (or finger) over the page and click 4 times quickly
- in the login box, enter your details from the email
- if all went well, you should no longer be anonymous .. well done ;)
- to change your password, use the terminal and type: `passwd`

Welcome to the team!
